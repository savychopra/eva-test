# Role Access Control

A Drupal module to handle access control based on role references.

## Concept

Role Access Control (RAC) was developed around the same idea of [Taxonomy Access
Control](https://www.drupal.org/project/tac_lite). The major difference is the
use of Role References instead of Taxonomy Terms. This simplifies the access
control configuration on site's who's TAC acls are mimicing the role list.

## Usage

RAC provides the base configuration and management of access rules. With one of
the contributed modules, access restrictions can be applied to Nodes, Paragraphs
or Field Collections Items.

## Support

This module was developed by the [Rutgers University Office of Information
Technology](https://oit.rutgers.edu). For support or questions, please contact
the OIT Webmaster(mailto:webmaster@oit.rutgers.edu).
