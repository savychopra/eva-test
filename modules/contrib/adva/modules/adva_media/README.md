# Advanced Access Media

This module provides Advanced Access support for the Media module in Drupal Core
starting with version 8.4.

## Contrib Media Entity Support

This module does not support the contrib media entity project. As the media
module is recommended for using on new sites. You should also attempt to update
older sites to use the core version of media. This process is documented on the
[Media Entity](https://www.drupal.org/project/media_entity) project page. If you
still wish to use this module alongside the Media Entity module, a patch is
available in [issue 2971237](https://www.drupal.org/project/adva/issues/2971237)
on Drupal.org.
